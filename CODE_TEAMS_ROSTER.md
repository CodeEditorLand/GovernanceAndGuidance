# Intro
See https://github.com/tauri-apps/rfcs/blob/master/texts/0003-code-teams.md for details.

This document will keep track of the current roster of the various code teams for Tauri. Someone can be on multiple teams at the same time, for now. You may request to be added to a team on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/SpmNs4S).

# Teams

Each team's primary function is to drive discussion and facilitate decisions around their area of the code. The team will make a final decision, but it cannot be finalized until the recommendation is put forward to the community to discuss. (The intent to prevent dictator or "from on high" type decisions.)

As decisions are made, the team should create tasks to take the decision to completion. The tasks should be of a size that is achievable in a PR. This will help scope work to something that anyone could reasonably hop into the code with minimal familiarity and help out.

Secondary responsibilities would be review the PRs and enable the docs to make it easy for someone to come in and contribute to that portion on the code. ("Docs" doesn't necessarily need to be something on tauri.studio.)
